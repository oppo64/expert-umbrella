        <h1>Hello, Visitor!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal webpage where I share my professional journey.</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am an IT professional and developer with a passion for technology and problem-solving. With a solid background in networking, system administration, and software development, I enjoy creating efficient solutions that meet modern challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. In my spare time, I love exploring new programming languages and working on personal projects that expand my skills.</p>

        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coding:</strong> Proficient in multiple programming languages, capable of developing efficient scripts and applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Experienced in configuring and managing key network services to ensure smooth operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Knowledgeable about IT security principles and implementing effective protective measures.</li>
            <li><strong>Troubleshooting Abilities:</strong> Skilled in diagnosing and resolving technical issues to maintain system functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Online Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Endless Runner Game:</strong> This project demonstrates coding principles through an interactive game, allowing users to visualize and manipulate code in real-time. It serves as a conceptual framework for exploring programming concepts such as algorithms and control flow, providing immediate visual feedback to enhance understanding. Developed using Unity, the game is designed for scalability and good file management.</li>
        
            <li>Development Highlights: Each of the three upgrades features a unique design, and coins accumulate across rounds.</li>
        </ul>
                <li><strong>Can:</strong> Attracts coins within a certain range.</li>
                <li><strong>Fishbone:</strong> Passes through obstacles.</li>
                <li><strong>Honey Jar:</strong> Creates a shield and interacts with monsters upon collision.</li>
            
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Wordpress Website:</strong> Please note that if you are unable to access the website, it may be due to the host's membership expiration, which currently prevents me from accessing the backend. However, if the website is accessible, please be aware that the images will not be displayed due to copyright reasons. Nevertheless, this website serves as an exemplary project showcasing its features and functionality.</li>
            <li>All components, aside from image display, should function perfectly, demonstrating the overall design and capabilities of the site. I believe that the operation of other website building tools will follow a similar approach, making it easy to adapt and apply the techniques acquired here.</li>

            <li><strong>Project Note:</strong> Please be advised that this project will not be updated moving forward. Additionally, the current focus of my efforts may not necessarily be represented through web applications in the future. This reflects a strategic shift in approach, allowing for exploration of diverse methodologies and technologies beyond traditional web development. However, there is a possibility that I may introduce new projects to replace the existing ones or migrate completed offline projects to this platform.</li>
